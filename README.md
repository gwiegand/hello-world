Most recently, I have been working at Pearson as a Director of Product, where I was responsible for 5 key areas:

	• leading a team  in the design, development, and implementation of IT learning products. 

	• I also served as Product Owner for application development projects serving internal and external customers

	• created product go-to-market strategies

	• managed our departmental budget, 

responsible for our official partnership alliances with Microsoft, Apple, Adobe, IBM and AARP. 

This is a new line about my job at Elanco.
